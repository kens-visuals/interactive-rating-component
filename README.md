## My process

### Built with

- React
- TailwindCSS
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first challenge completed with Tailwind CSS. As most of the people, at the beginning, I was skeptical about Tailwind CSS, but after playing with it for a while I decided to give it a try in one of the challenges. Since this was I small challenge, I decided to add a bit more functionality, so I created a data.json file and included some of my previous projects, their screenshots, links to live website and repository. I think it came out pretty cool. And yes I liked Tailwind CSS, I'm planning on using it on a bigger project.

### Continued development

I want to focus more on `tailwind.config.js` file to make things more reusable and also add more custom sizes.
